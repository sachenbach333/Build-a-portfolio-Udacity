# Build-a-portfolio-Udacity
A responsive web design from a pdf mockup of a portfolio for Full-stack web design nanodegree at Udacity
Synopsis

This is the second project for Udacityâ€™s Full-Stack Nanodegree. This is a portfolio site built from a .pdf mock-up to eventually display projects built throughout the degree.  It is built using responsive design in HTML and CSS.

Code Example

Below is an example of the code displaying the featured work icons and links:
<div class="featured row">
                  <h2>Featured Work</h2>
             </div>
                <div class="row">
                <!--Three images representing project icons - take up third of column but wrap as screen gets smaller-->
                    <div class="projectimage col-4">
                      <img src="images/appimage.png" srcset="images/appimage_2x.jpg 2x , images/appimage_3x.jpg 3x " alt="APP IMAGE"/>
                        <h2>APPIFY</h2>
                        <!--Link to projects-TODO make links active as projects complete-->
                        <a href="#">https://github.com/udacity/Appify/</a>
